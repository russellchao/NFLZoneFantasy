### 🎰 An Alternative to Traditional Betting
- Betting on the NFL (and sports in general) can make games more exciting, but it often comes at the cost of real money. NFL Zone offers a fun, risk-free alternative by using a points system instead. Every new user starts with 0 points and can win or lose points based on the “bets” they place. Beyond betting, NFL Zone includes a variety of interactive features that also reward or deduct points. As users earn points, they can unlock features, participate in exclusive activities, and gain bragging rights on leaderboards.
